## Getting Started

To get the app up and running on your local development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samuelj90/QrimsAndroid.git
   cd QrimsAndroid
   ```

2. **Setup Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `app/` directory.
   - Enable Firebase Authentication and Firestore Database for storing cart, wishlist, and order data.

3. **Stripe Configuration**:
   - Register your app with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api) to obtain API keys.
   - Set up the Stripe SDK by following the instructions on [Stripe's Android documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment).

4. **Build and Run**:
   - Open the project in Android Studio, sync Gradle, and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

## Architecture

QrimsAndroid follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture with a clean separation of concerns:

- **Data Layer**: Handles data storage and retrieval with Room and Firebase, along with repository patterns.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains use cases that orchestrate complex logic and interactions between data sources.
- **Presentation Layer**: Uses Jetpack Compose and Android ViewModel for responsive and interactive UI.

The architecture ensures scalability and maintainability, making it ideal for enterprise-level applications.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Network**: Retrofit, Firebase Firestore
- **Database**: Room Database for offline caching
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Payment**: Stripe SDK
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install Android Studio** (v4.0 or later) and Java JDK 8 or later.
2. **Sync Gradle** and ensure all dependencies are installed.

**Environment Configuration**: Place sensitive keys (like Stripe API keys) in environment-specific configuration files.
